# Rainfall-prediction-project
Rainfall_prediction project based on logistic regression

some importan points in the project
Used Barplot to check the relation between the dataset, and also used distplot to check whether data is normally distributed or skewed.

And at last main model comes into the picture which is used to check whether the dataset I had built is working well or not by using Logistic Regression. Accuracy_score using Logistic Regression is coming to 90%.

While using some metrics of classification like precision, recall, and F1 score my model is working well.
